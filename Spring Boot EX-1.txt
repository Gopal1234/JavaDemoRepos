1.You need to build a Spring Boot REST API to manage students in a college.

The data should be stored in an postgresSql database.

Requirements

create layered structure 
inside model layer---create Student class as per the given json details
inside service layer---create StudentInterface and define all expected method as the given requirements
inside dao layer--implement all service methods
inside controller layer--define all endpoints



Add a new Student

Endpoint: POST /students

Request body:

{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Amit Sharma",
  "age": 20,
  "course": "Computer Science"
}


Store student in a collection.

Get all Students

Endpoint: GET /students

Return the list of all students.

Get Student by ID

Endpoint: GET /students/{id}

Return student details if found, otherwise return 404.

Update Student

Endpoint: PUT /students/{id}

Update an existing studentâ€™s details in the collection.

Delete Student

Endpoint: DELETE /students/{id}

Remove student from collection.

Additional features:

Filter students by course
GET /students/course/{courseName}

Get students above a certain age
GET /students/age/{minAge}

Sort students by age
GET /students/sort/age

2.Develop a  Hospital Management System (HMS) backend using Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA that allows registration of patients, management of doctors, and booking of appointments.
The system should ensure data validation, prevent invalid operations (like double-booking), and return consistent error messages using global exception handling.

ðŸ“Œ Modules (only important ones)
1. Patient Management

Register new patients with details: name, email, phone, date of birth.

Update and fetch patient information.

Search patient by name/email.

Validation Rules:

name â†’ @NotBlank

email â†’ @Email

phone â†’ @Pattern(regexp="^[0-9]{10}$")

dob â†’ @Past

2. Doctor Management

Register doctors with details: name, specialty, email, consultation fee.

List all doctors or search by specialty.

Validation Rules:

name â†’ @NotBlank

specialty â†’ @NotBlank

email â†’ @Email

consultationFee â†’ @Min(100)

3. Appointment Scheduling

Book an appointment between a patient and a doctor at a given date/time.

Prevent double-booking: doctor cannot have two appointments at the same time.

Cancel or reschedule appointments.

Validation Rules:

appointmentDateTime â†’ @Future

durationMinutes â†’ @Min(15)
